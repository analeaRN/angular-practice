# IlocanoFlashCards

A small project I've created to learn more about Angular!

This is a stateless app that takes allows users to review a few common Ilocano words.
The user can pick how many cards they want to review in a session and how they would like to review it.

Users can review via:
- Drag n' Drop
- Typing out the translation

While users do reviews, the app keeps track of their correct or incorrect guesses for that session.
(Sessions reset every page reload).
